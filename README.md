Build a handwritten digit recognition system using SVM in Python for precise classification. 
Employ SVM in Python, optimize model via hyperparameter tuning, enhancing generalization and reducing 
overfitting, and archived 98% accuracy.  
Obtained expertise in SVM for image classification, refined hyperparameter tuning skills, and addressed 
overfitting in ML models.
